## Privacy Policy

The privacy of my visitors is extremely important. This Privacy Policy outlines the types of personal information that is received and collected and how it is used.

First and foremost, I will never share your email address or any other personal information with anyone.

### Log Files

Like many other websites, this site uses log files to help learn about when, from where, and how often traffic flows to this site. The information in these log files include:

* Anonymized Internet Protocol addresses (IP)
* Types of browser
* Internet Service Provider (ISP)
* Date and time stamp
* Referring and exit pages
* Number of clicks

None of this information is linked to anything that is personally identifiable.

### Cookies and Web Beacons

When you visit this site "convenience" cookies are stored on your computer when you submit a comment to help you log in faster to [CommentBox](http://commentbox.com) the next time you leave a comment.

If you wish to disable cookies, you may do so through your web browser options. Instructions for doing so can be found on the specific web browsers' websites, or for consolidated instructions you can visit [Cookies and You](http://cookiesandyou.com/).

#### Google Analytics

Google Analytics is a web analytics tool I use to help understand how visitors engage with this website. It reports website trends using cookies and web beacons without identifying individual visitors. You can read [Google Analytics Privacy Policy](http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html).

#### Google Adsense

Google Adsense, a third party affiliate marketing network, uses cookies to help make sure I get a commission when you buy a product after clicking on a link or ad banner that takes you to the site of one of their merchants. You can read [Google Adsense Privacy Policy](http://support.google.com/adsense/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=48182).

## Disclosure Policy

I may (try to) make money on this website through affiliate programs. If you click an affiliate link or ad banner and buy the product, you help support this website because I'll get a percentage of that sale.

What this means for you:

* I do not and will not recommend a product just for the sake of making money
* I do not receive any compensation for anything I link to, nor does anyone influence the content, topics, posts, or opinions expressed on this website
* I respect and value my readers too much to write anything other than my own genuine and objective opinions and advice

Just like this website, my Disclosure Policy is a work in progress. As the revenue streams evolve, so will this page.

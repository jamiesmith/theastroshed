## About this Site

This site focuses primarily on my endeavors in astrophotography-- gear, process,
software, and, of course, targets & images.  I reserve the right :wink: to delve
into other topics that are loosely related to astrophotography-- If I have to
pack it into the van for a night observing then it is fair game.  Posts will be
tagged appropriately so readers don't have to suffer through topics they aren't
interested in.

This site is very much a work in progress.  Really only the overall look is how
I want it.  There is not yet a commenting system (which makes sense, since there
is not really anything to comment _on_).  Odds are that, once I get my permanent
observatory set up, I will also start recording some video content.  We will see
how that goes - I have been told that "I have a face for radio".  That's good,
right?

### Getting Around

This site has a pretty simple layout - it's all static thanks to
[jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), and should be fairly responsive. At the top you
see a main navigation bar.  The top left corner has the site title which will
always get you back to the root level.  Navigation is broken up into "posts" and
"notes".

Posts are like journal entries, happening at a point in time.  They will contain
_tags_, which tell you the main topic.  I don't have the list of tags yet, but
you can be sure that `astrophotography` and `image` will be in the mix.  You can
find posts by either [date](/year-archive/) or by [tag](/tags/).

Notes, on the other hand, are more "timeless".  These might be tutorials or
little one-offs.  Full disclosure here - I won't know what goes where until I
actually put up some content, but I _promise_ that I will update this doc when I
do.  Unless I forget.

### Minutia

For hosting I leverage [GitHub Pages and Jekyll](https://help.github.com/articles/about-github-pages-and-jekyll/), 
and use a somewhat tweaked version of the 
[minimal-mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) theme, with a dark color palette.

If you'd like to see _what_ I've tweaked, you can always 
[fork the repo](https://github.com/jamiesmith/minimal-mistakes).

Some handy documents for the theme:

- [Quick-Start Guide](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/)
- [Sample Pages](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/year-archive/)

Fast forward a few years... 

My second scope, purchased in 2012, was an [8" Celestron CPC Edge HD](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005FY4N4U).  This was a beautiful telescope.  It was much easier to align than the ETX-90 was, and its longer focal length was fantastic for planets and the moon.

I actually had this 'scope for a few years.  It was used primarily for visual work, at which it did excel.  I was able to hook a camera up to it at prime focus, but nothing really came from that.  This moon shot is probably the best that I had:

I spent many months enjoying the CPC. If it was clear, it was set up.  I had an issue with it at one point, basically the logic board died.  That required shipping and about 2 months of time for Celestron to swap it out.  I was so happy to learn that it was a _two_ year warranty, as opposed to just a one year.  Once I got it back it never held the same "joy" that it had originally.  Eventually I ended up getting frustrated, realizing that I bought this scope before doing sufficient research.  I spent quite a bit of money (the CPC, some extra eyepieces, and *cough* an unused hyperstar) and realized that I really couldn't image from my yard.  I basically only have a view to the north- which is exactly where ~~downtown~~ uptown Charlotte is relative to me.  I sold the scope in 2014, thinking that my hobby was dead in the water.  

Then, in 2017 I learned about the [Charlotte Amateur Astronomy Club](http://www.charlotteastronomers.org), and learned that its members have access to the Gayle H. Riggsbee Observatory near Taxahaw, SC.  Not exactly a dark-sky site, but you can actually see hints of the Milky Way with the naked eye.  Plus, it is only about 45 minutes away from home!

THAT is when I started plotting...

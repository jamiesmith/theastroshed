That brings us to today.  

Like many aspiring astrophotographers, I had my dream setup planned out.  Like many plans, it was somewhat "fluid".

Over the next couple of  ~~days~~ weeks I will go through a set of "unboxing posts" (not as much fun as videos, but hopefully informative none-the-less), along with a brief description of what other choices were on my radar and what "tipped the scales".  I researched and researched.  Analysis paralysis started setting in, and finally I made up my mind and pulled the trigger.  Where applicable, I will also let you know what stuff went back.

Keep in mind as you read these (if, in fact, anyone does) that I am really new to all of this.  I hope to catalog my journey, my progress, and my mistakes.  Hopefully as I go the former will start to outweigh the latter :wink:.

I knew that my wife wouldn't let me buy this stuff _again_; I had to do it right.  She is a [portrait & pet photographer](https://www.akbsphoto.com), so she is often "gear shopping" (in fact I know that earlier today she was looking at the [Nikon 105mm f/1.4E](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01J4S9YRI) lens), so she does understand.  To an extent.  

I had a bullet list of the bigger things that I needed:

- Sturdy, automated, go-to mount
- Small(ish) refractor, preferably apochromatic, either with a flat field, or a flattener available
  - Bonus points if the system allowed threaded (vs compression) connections in the imaging train
- solid, automated focusing (focus, as mentioned in other posts, was a touchy area for me)
- A monochrome, cooled camera
  - Preferably with a large sensor
  - I had no CMOS vs CCD bias (see what I did there?  bias?)
- A filter wheel for said camera
- Filters that would not cause halos
- A guiding system
  - at the start I wasn't sure on on or off-axis guiding
- A way to _control_ all of this
- A way to _power_ all of this
- Dew prevention

Yeah, there are many other little things here and there.  But how much could those things add up to :moneybag:?

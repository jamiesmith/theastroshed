Another quick post. I have finally had my first night imaging remotely, and everything actually worked!

This was actually over two nights: June 7 & 8, 2024. June 7th I was at the 'shed,
making sure that everything would actually work (and fixing something that I 
screwed up with the rotator). I ran the exact same sequence in NINA that I
will use when imaging remotely on the 8th. Everything worked out! I'm switching to doing
unguided imaging for a future arrival (spoilers) and it's working out pretty well-- 
it feels like I'm actually acquiring considerably more "image" time vs wasted 
"why isn't guiding working" time. I did adjust my sub length from five minutes 
to three to accomodate the lack of guiding.

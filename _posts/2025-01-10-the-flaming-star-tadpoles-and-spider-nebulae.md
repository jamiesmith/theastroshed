I gathered about 40 hours of narrowband and broadband data for this rendition of the Flaming Star, 
Tadpoles, and Spider Nebulae over a ten-day session in late 2024/early 2025.

## Region overview

_Overview generated by AI, prompt below_

The night sky is home to some of the most breathtaking celestial wonders, with 
three nebulae that showcase the awe-inspiring beauty of star formation. The 
Flaming Star, Tadpoles, and Spider Nebulae are three distinct yet captivating 
objects in the universe. 
 
The Flaming Star Nebula, also known as NGC 2264, is a stunning emission nebula 
located about 1,500 light-years away from Earth. With an apparent size of 
approximately 6 arcminutes, this nebula is visible to the naked eye on a clear 
night. Its vibrant red color is due to the presence of hydrogen and helium gas, 
which are ionized by the intense radiation of young stars. The Flaming Star 
Nebula is also notable for its complex structure, with multiple layers of dense 
gas and dust that give rise to new star formation. 
 
The Tadpole Galaxy, also known as NGC 3992, is a spiral galaxy located about 60 
million light-years away from Earth. With an apparent size of approximately 30 
arcminutes, this galaxy is easily visible through a telescope. The name 
"Tadpole" was coined due to the galaxy's unique shape, which resembles that of 
an aquatic animal. The Tadpole Galaxy is also home to a supermassive black hole 
at its center, which is responsible for regulating the flow of gas and star 
formation within the galaxy. 
 
The Spider Nebula, also known as NGC 6820-2, is a small dwarf spheroidal 
satellite galaxy located about 1.4 million light-years away from Earth. With an 
apparent size of approximately 30 arcminutes, this galaxy is difficult to spot 
with the naked eye but can be observed through a telescope. The Spider Nebula is 
notable for its unique structure, which features a central core surrounded by a 
disk of older stars and dark matter. Its proximity to the Milky Way Galaxy makes 
it an interesting target for astronomers studying the formation and evolution of 
satellite galaxies. 

## Acquisition Details
- **Mount**: Astro-Physics Mach2GTO
- **Telescope**: Takahashi FSQ-106EDXv4
- **Camera**: ZWO ASI6200MM

The data for this was captured over several nights (December 30 & 31, 2024, 
and January 1, 4, 7, and 8, 2025), gathering 290 unguided subs for a total of 39.67 hours. 

It's a single framing (not mosaic), based on what could nicely fit on the sensor.

Per-filter totals:
- Red:      2.67 hours (32 subs)
- Green:    2.83 hours (34 subs)
- Blue:     3.17 hours (38 subs)
- Sii:     11.83 hours (71 subs)
- Ha:      11.00 hours (66 subs)
- Oiii:     8.17 hours (49 subs)
- total:   39.67 hours (290 subs)

## Processing details

All processing was done in PixInsight, using several plugins and scripts.

### RGB filters
The processing included (see the updated processing icons [here](https://github.com/jamiesmith/pixinsight-icons)):
- For each of the RGB channels:
  - Dynamic Crop
  - GradientCorrecton
  - BlurXTerminator (correct only)
- RGB combination via PixelMath
- Auto Linear Fit
- ImageSolver
- SpectrophotometricColorCalibration (PhotonFlux)
- BlurXTerminator (full)
- NoiseXTerminator
- StarXTerminator
- Stretched the stars via SetiAstro's "Star Stretch" ()
- GHS and a bit of curves to stretch the starless
  - several iterations with masks to get rid of some leftover star halos

### Narrowband Filters
- For each of the individual Ha, Oiii, and Sii master images:
- BlurXTerminator (full)
- GradientCorrection
- NoiseXTerminator
- StarXTerminator (I didn't use the stars from these)
- Preliminary stretch with SetiAstro's StatisticalStretch
- GHS and a bit of curves to stretch each starless image and set the black point

### Combination
At this point I had 5 stretched (AKA "non-linear") images to combine: 
- RGB Starless
- RGB Stars
- Sii Starless
- Ha Starless
- Oiii Starless

Time to start combining!
- Combined HOO with PixelMath
- NarrowbandNormalization for HOO with blend set to zero
- Used the NBColourMapper to convert the Sii image to a color image, hue==45

I then screened the colorized Sii image on to the bi-color HOO 
image using the ImageBlend script. I spent a lot of time with 
iterating between curves and GHS to get the image where I liked 
it, trying very hard to not lose the Tadpoles in the process. I also 
used a mask to reduce some extra halos left between the Flaming Star 
and Tadpoles

Finally, I used a PixelMath script to sprinkle the RGB stars back in. For 
fun (and comparison) I also made an RGB-only version

If you click on one of the gallery images  you can use the arrow keys to 
flip between them to see the differences between the narrowband, RGB, and starless 
narrowband version

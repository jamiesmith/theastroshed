    title: M51 in RGB

In my quest to image remotely I needed a dry run.

{%
  include figure image_path="/assets/images/posts/quick-shot-of-m51-the-whirlpool-galaxy/M51.jpg"
  caption="Looks like a seahorse to me"
%}

Just a quick evening pointing at M51 using NINA and the new Target Scheduler plugin. 
For some reason the Target Scheduler wasn't being cooperative, and rather than 
do the configured "LRGB LRGB dither" it just took whatever images it felt like. 
I ended up with 33 red, 30 green, and only 16 blue.

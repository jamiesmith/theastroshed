Things have been changing pretty rapidly in the astrophotography world. What,
for years, had been a pretty slow pace, has had a generational leap
with the advent of new "smart" telescopes and improved smartphone cameras.

Astro-image processing is in the same boat. Image processing workflows in
PixInsight were fairly stable for several years. Yeah, there were a few
new utilities that made things easier (Weighted Batch Preprocessor, or WBPP
comes to mind.) But, in the fairly recent past, other new tools have completely
changed the game, providing a generational leap in image processing- things like
[RC-Astro's *XTerminator tools](https://www.rc-astro.com/software/)
(Star, Noise, and Blur). Even Generalized Hyperbolic Stretch (GHS) has 
had a big impact- at least on how I work.

In this post I'll walk through a high-level overview of how I process images.
It's repeatable, pretty streamlined, and I think that you can get pretty good
results without a lot of theory or math.

I'll start out by reiterating that this is my _2024 workflow_, because odds are
that it will change. More new tools, new techniques, and more _learning_.

If you want to cut to the chase, you can (always) download my process icons by
cloning my [pixinsight-icons](https://github.com/jamiesmith/pixinsight-icons)
GitHub repo or downloading them as a [*zip
file*](https://github.com/jamiesmith/pixinsight-icons/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)

# High-high-level overview of the process

For my primary imaging rig (I should document that somewhere, it's gone through
a few revisions), I tend to shoot both narrowband and broadband images, with
per-filter exposure times as follows:
- Lum (180s)
- Red (300s)
- Green (300s)
- Blue (300s)
- Sii (600s)
- Ha (600s)
- Oiii (600s)

If I'm just processing a single night of data I might not go through the entire
process, but even then it's still similar to the flow I use for *final* images.

A preliminary step is to use WBPP to calibrate and cosmetically correct frames
(if that's not already done), and to align, register and integrate them. I turn
off the autocrop and embedding of the rejection maps in WBPPâ€“ My raw frames are
already 120mb, I don't need them bigger :grinning:

Once I've got the calibrated and integrated master frames, I proceed to the
flow. Note that for things like globular clusters I might not do the SHO path,
unless there's something interesting.

- Open, tile, rename, and stretch the applicable L/R/G/B and S/H/O frames
- Process the RGB frames together
- Process the SHO frames _separately_
- Merge the RGB stars with the SHO starless
- Final tweaking

# Breaking down the flow snapshot

%}

For the first "Open, tile, rename, and stretch" step I use the [scripts that I
created](/image-processing-with-pixinsight-scripts-from-theastroshed/) to get to
a baseline view of what I've got. In this case you can see what that looks like
for the Heart Nebula that I recently processed. Once I'm to this point I can
start the flows

Disclaimer on any of the menus/script locations: Some of the tools aren't built
in, but if you include the repos in the appendix they should be in the right
places.

## The RGB Workflow
![image-right]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/posts/my-rgb-and-sho-workflows-2024-edition/rgb-icons.jpg){: .align-right} 

- `DynamicCrop` (note that I crop the SHO and RGB frames with the same instance of dynamic crop)
- Combine (L)RGB channels (I just open this and run it)
- Rename the combined image as `RGB` (I still use an `ImageIdentifier` icon for this, since it's static)
- Once I've got the RGB image I usually iconize the individual channels and drag them off to the side
- at this point it's probably going to be way off on color, so I do an unlinked STF stretch
- Run the script `AutoLinearFit` on the combined RGB, usually set to use the red frame (alternatively, manual linear fit, before the combine)
  - A note here: I've had issues with BlurXTerminator if I use the `Lowest Mean` setting on`AutoLinearFit`
- Another unlinked STF stretch here doesn't hurt
- Gradient Removal: I run through a few different methods to see which works best for a particular image. I go through these tools to compare:
  - Seti Astro's "Automatic DBE"
  - GraXpert
  - The new GradientCorrection tool
  - I generally clone the RGB image during the gradient experimentation, but when I've chosen, I _apply it to the actual RGB so the image history stays intact_
- I drop on the `BlurX_CorrectOnly` icon, which is BlurXTerminator, with the "correct only" option selected
  - This is supposed to help with the plate solve (which usually gets borked in the crop)
  - I actually don't always do this step unless the next ones fail
- I drop on the `PlateSolveForSCC` icon to get the solution. Even though the crop loses data, this usually still works
- Then comes the actual SPCC, or `Spectophotometric Color Calibration`, for which I use one of two flavors, depending on the object type:
  - For spiral galaxies, I drop on the `SPCC_RGB_ASG` icon (the "ASG" is for "average spiral galaxy")
  - For everything else I use the `SPCC_RGB_PF` (photon flux) variant
  - An important note for this step is that you MUST UPDATE the process to set the correct sensor and filter types for your equipment. Once you do that you can swap out the icon for your info
- **CHECKPOINT**: We should now have a gradient-free, color-calibrated image
- Perform a full BlurXTerminator correction, by dropping on the `BlurX_Full` icon
- Drop on the `RGB_AddStarless_2_ID`, to rename the image to `RGB_starless`
- If needed I drop on the `FixMagentaStars`
- I'd then try noise reduction with NoiseXTerminator by dropping on the `NoiseX_Tweak` icon
  - I call it "tweak" because, with some images, I've got to jiggle the handles a bit to get a good look
  - Like above, I make sure that the final execution is on the same image with the history
- We're now getting in the home stretch! I extract the stars with StarXTerminator by dropping on `StarX` (which has the "Unscreen" option checked)
- Finally, I carefully make the STF-autostretched stars stretch permanent, by dragging the STF state onto the `HistogramTransformation` process, then applying it to the stars

At this point I might be done with the RGB side, unless there's something cool
in the starless version. If I did it all right, I'm ending up with two new
images: an `RGB_starless` and `RGB_starless_stars`. I might play with the
starless version and rescreen the stars (definitely will if there aren't any
narrowband frames), but I usually move on to the SHO side.

## SHO Workflow
Right off the bat - there are some icons in this that I _do not use_, but I keep
them around for quick sanity checks of data. A good example are the SPCC steps
in the SHO path

![image-right]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/posts/my-rgb-and-sho-workflows-2024-edition/sho-icons.jpg){: .align-right} 

Like the RGB flow, I'm starting out with open narrowband frames, but I don't merge them right away, but rather do a little mental loop...
For EACH of the SHO frames, I do the following:
- Perform some magic by dropping the `SHO_BlurX_Full` icon on them
- Experiment with the various gradient removal techniques, similar to the RGB flow (but, instead, on the discrete frames)
- OPTIONALLY, Stretch the frames with GHS (this can be done later, after they're combined)

**Then** I combine the images into an SHO image, mapping Sii --> Red, Ha -->
**Green, and Oiii --> Blue. **Don't Panic**. It's gonna be green. Very
**green... There are a couple different options, but the straight channel
**mapping has been working for me as it goes through the workflow

- With my newly combined image, I drop on the `Rename_SHO` icon to change the image identifier to be `SHO`
- I run the script `Script -> Toolbox -> AutoLinearFit` on the new `SHO` with the green channel as the reference
- I perform `NarrowbandNormalization` on the `SHO` image, selecting the `SHO` palette, turning on the live preview, and tweaking the channel controls and adjustments (if you don't know what they do, just crank them to 0 or 11 to see the impact)
- then an STF autostretch
- I skip the SPCC options
- In preparation for StarX, I drop on the `SHO_AddStarless_2_ID`, to rename my `SHO` to `SHO_starless`
- I drop the `NoiseX_TWEAK_SHO` icon onto the image, then decide if I need to tweak the settings (I find that, once you're familiar with your images, you can get pretty consistent results)
- then, nuke the stars!
  - This should leave you with `SHO_starless` and `SHO_starless_stars` images
  - if you have an `RGB_starless_stars` image, the `SHO_starless` image is probably no longer needed
- If you haven't stretched yet (AKA, the image is still linear), run a GHS on the `SHO_starless` image
  - Experiment on where you do this step (before vs after combining). It's easy to overstretch if you do it earlier in the process, but you can get a lot more detail that way
- Depending on the subject, I try the "DarkStructureEnhance" script, which is in the `Script --> Utilities` menu

The rest is usually experimenting with the overall look. Maybe enhancing the hue
or saturation with curves or a "local histogram equalization".

The last step is screening back in the stars, but I usually safe off a copy of
the `SHO_starless` image first. If the `RGB_starless_stars` are too big I try to
shrink them a bit.

You can use basic pixelmath for that, or the new ImageBlend script (I've got
icons for both of those). If you've been following the same conventions I have
they should just work. If you HAVEN'T, change the icons to match your flow.

This Heart Nebula was the first image that I took through this flow start to
finish, and I was very pleased with the results (and I even got a top-pick
nomination for it on AstroBin)

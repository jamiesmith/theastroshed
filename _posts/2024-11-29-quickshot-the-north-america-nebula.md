A quick process of the North America Nebula. This is about eighteen hours of SHO + RGB data and I like how it turned out :smiley:.

See below for acquisition details.

The North America Nebula, designated as NGC 7000, is an astronomical object located in the constellation Cygnus. As seen through a telescope or binoculars, it appears as a wispy, ethereal cloud of gas and dust, measuring approximately 5 degrees across.

Located at a distance of about 6,500 light-years from Earth, the North America Nebula offers a glimpse into the distant reaches of our galaxy. Astronomers believe that the nebula was created when a massive star exploded in a supernova event, scattering gas and dust particles throughout its surroundings. Over time, these particles coalesced into new stars, and planetary systems.

One fascinating aspect of the North America Nebula is its intricate network of tendrils and filaments, which resemble the coastline of North America. These structures are formed by the nebula's interaction with nearby star clusters and interstellar gas flows.

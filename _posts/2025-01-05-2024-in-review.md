2024 was a great year for theAstroShed, and I gathered a lot of faint light 
from far away. By far the image that I was happiest with was the Heart Nebula, 
but the Horsehead/Flame nebulas and Pleiades aren't far behind. Click through to see
bigger images.

I've been refining my [image processing](/my-rgb-and-sho-workflows-2024-edition/)
(well, maybe "re-learning" is a better word). Spoilers: I am constantly refining the workflows. 
I even published a few PixInsight scripts, described on that same post.

You can jump to the [2024 index](/year-archive/#2024) if you want to see additional 
details, but I've gathered some of the images here to serve as an index of sorts.

I've already got some quality time on IC 405 & IC 410, but that's for another
day (and after I get a lot more data!)

Thanks for looking, be sure to follow me on [AstroBin](http://www.astrobin.com/users/jamiesmithnc/)!

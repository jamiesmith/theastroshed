One issue that I had early on was getting to the astroshed. Not the drive (well, 
the South Carolina roads do leave a bit to be desired). No, it was the little OSB
plywood walkway.

The initial plan was to throw down some gravel or crush & run there, but that never
happened. Instead, when the astronomy club was adding a couple more observing pads,
they built out nice little sidewalks for us. Now we've got a place to sit outside, 
chat, and, of course, look up.

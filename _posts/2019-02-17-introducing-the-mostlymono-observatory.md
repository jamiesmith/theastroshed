    title: Early on in the construction phase.  First chance I had to go out there when they were building and they made quite a bit of progress!  This one shows the door side, with a cutout for a window.

    title: The north wall.  It's hard to see, but there are two panels that fold down into the room

    title: They are starting on the hip roof

    title: The roof has been completed!

    title: Metal roofing installed!

    title: Temporary workspace.  I need something a bit wider, yet shallower.
  - image_path: /assets/images/posts/AstroShed/observatory-side-1.jpg
    title: View of the observatory side, before the 'scope was set up.  I didn't have power wired up at this point, but they did leave it so I could just plug the whole building into an extension cord
  - image_path: /assets/images/posts/AstroShed/custom-desk-2.jpg
    title: Got some wall cabinets from Lowe's, cut down a stock counter to 18-inch deep and made a desk out of them. There was _just_ enough room above the window for a couple of wall cabinets
  - image_path: /assets/images/posts/AstroShed/custom-desk-3.jpg
    title: Of course, no observatory is complete without a bottle opener.  Yeah, I know, I still have to put on the side panel for the counter

    title: Trenching for conduit!

    title: Kinda looks like we have a gopher problem...

    title: The trencher made things MUCH easier
  - image_path: /assets/images/posts/AstroShed/trenching-2.jpg
    title: The trencher didn't turn well.  Or at all.
  - image_path: /assets/images/posts/AstroShed/trenching-6.jpg
    title: Also trenched for networking
  - image_path: /assets/images/posts/AstroShed/trenching-7.jpg
    title: The trencher made a nice ~4-inch groove

With the Astroshed nearly complete I thought that it was time to post some pictures of the progress and what all has gone into this project.

We built the astroshed at GHRO (the Gayle H. Riggsbee Observatory) which is about 50 minutes from my house.  Very special thanks to all of the great [CAAC](http://www.charlotteastronomers.org) members that helped with this project, I couldn't have done it without you!
